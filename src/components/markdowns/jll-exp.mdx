### Shaping the Future of Real Estate

As a Full Stack Developer at JLL, the second-largest real estate company in the world, I had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects that transformed the industry.
My journey began as a Senior UI Developer for Global Property Solution, a research application designed to provide accurate and comprehensive commercial property data to real estate agents worldwide.

### Redux-Based Architecture: A Game-Changer for Search Pages

One of my most notable achievements was resolving a complex state management issue, earning me a Certificate of Appreciation from JLL.
To tackle this challenge, I implemented a Redux-based, configuration-driven architecture for the search page, allowing us to onboard five additional entities seamlessly. This innovative solution resulted in a potential 60% reduction in lines of code and significantly faster feature delivery.

In another project, I developed a GraphQL API leveraging Azure Cognitive Search and serverless functions.
To ensure the API's reliability, I wrote comprehensive unit tests, achieving an impressive 85% code coverage using Jest.
This API has become a cornerstone of JLL's technology stack, enabling faster and more efficient data processing.

Throughout my tenure at JLL, I worked on various projects, switching between frontend and backend development, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions.
My experience at JLL has not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the real estate industry and its evolving needs.
