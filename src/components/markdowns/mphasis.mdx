As I embarked on my professional journey at Mphasis, I was presented with a unique opportunity to explore a wide range of programming languages, including Java, Python, and JavaScript.
This exposure not only broadened my technical horizons but also instilled in me a passion for continuous learning.

Worked on a variety of projects at Mphasis, including a single-page Angular 2+ full stack application, mobile application automation testing and web app workflow automation.
