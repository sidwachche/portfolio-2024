### From Angular to React: A Transformative Experience

As a Frontend Developer at Hashedin, I embarked on an exciting journey, starting with a Honeywell project that introduced me to the simplicity and elegance of React.
Coming from an Angular background, I was thrilled to discover the joys of React, initially with class-based components and later with functional components. The experience was transformative, and I was hooked!

### A World of Possibilities: Discovering React's Capabilities

As I delved deeper into the React ecosystem, I explored Redux and various libraries, expanding my skill set and appreciation for the framework.
Collaborating with a global team, I learned the importance of simple, clean code, and the value of thoughtful naming conventions and functional programming principles.

### Delivering a Seamless User Experience with React

On the Honeywell project, I was responsible for developing and delivering a single-page React application with TypeScript, designed to manage a portfolio of connected IoT devices.
I successfully integrated GraphQL, Elastic Search, O-Data, and REST web services, creating a seamless user experience.

To ensure a responsive and visually appealing design, I utilized InVision mock prototypes to craft layouts that would adapt effortlessly to various devices and screen sizes.
Furthermore, I wrote comprehensive unit test cases using Jest and Enzyme, ensuring the application's reliability and maintainability.

### Rapid Growth and Professional Development at Hashedin

My time at Hashedin was a period of rapid growth, both technically and professionally. I refined my skills, adopted best practices, and developed a deeper understanding of what it means to write clean, efficient, and scalable code.
This experience has had a lasting impact on my approach to software development, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of the Hashedin team.
